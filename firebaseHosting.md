## Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting and(optionally) set up GitHub Action

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

## Use an existing project

## movix-adfcd (Movix)

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

to /index.html)? No
